Traffic sign detection and interpretation is an important element of advanced driver assistance systems in vehicles, and is integral to the development of fully autonomous vehicles. An important subset of traffic signs are signs that indicate that a speed limit is in operation, and for which correct detection is particularly critical. Camera-based technologies are an obvious way to achieve this goal. The objective of this mini-project is to develop a system to detect speed limit signs, and to determine the applicable speed limit, by processing a database of test images that will be provided. The overall functionality of the system can be divided into two main components:
1. Detection of a traffic sign/speed limit sign within the scene; this represents a “region of interest” within which other processing needs to be carried out;
2. Analyse the content of the speed limit sign, and determine the speed limit.
